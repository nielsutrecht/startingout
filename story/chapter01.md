## Chapter One

"My head. Fuck that hurts. Where am I? What planet is this?"

When my vision starts to get less blurry I see that I am in some kind of desert. Through my cracked visor I smell a hint of 
ammonia but it seems like I got lucky with a breatheable atmosphere. It looks like Mars but it clearly isn't; over the horizon 
I see two stars so this must be a binary system.
